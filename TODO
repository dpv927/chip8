--------------------------- IMPLEMENTED
- Timers update.
- Sound "beep" when the sound timer != 0.
- Memory Debug (registers, display, etc)
- Makefile options for Debug and Release

--------------------------- SOLVED BUGS

- Now the display buffer draws all shapes correctly, including the overwrite 
  values (This last feature was not working). To do so, we now use the ClearBackground
  function from raylib at every frame (using BLACK as background). 
  
  Because at every frame the window is cleared to black, we need to repaint the display
  buffer to the window (maybe not is not ideal but the performance is not affected). 
  Knowing that, the `cpu_draw` is now removed, because this flag told us when was neccesary
  to repaint the display buffer in the window at every frame.

--------------------------- POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS

- Develop a graphical user interface for easier ROM selection and execution.

- Improve opcode switch stement to a adress table. (Currenty if there are 'n' opcodes in a same
  nibble, it may cost O(n) to find the corresponding function for that opcode. Thats because
  the current 'switch' statement is more like a if-else statement). However, performance is not
  affected by the current approach, as 60fps is reached very comfortably.
