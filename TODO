--------------------------- IMPLEMENTED
- Timers update.
- Sound "beep" when the sound timer != 0.
- Memory Debug (registers, display, etc)
- Makefile options for Debug and Release

--------------------------- BUGS
- Somehow the display buffer draws all shapes correctly, but when it has
  to override any value of the buffer (from 1 to 0, which sets v[f]=1), 
  the output window does not match with the display buffer, where the 
  display buffer always has the correct values.
    - Possible causes:
      - 0 values at the buffer when processing at _draw_display are ommited

--------------------------- IMPROVEMENTS

- Develop a graphical user interface for easier ROM selection and execution.

- Improve opcode switch stement to a adress table.
  (Currenty if there are 'n' opcodes in a same
  nibble, it may cost O(n) to find the corresponding
  function for that opcode. Thats because the current 'switch'
  statement is more like a if-else statement).
