- Improve .asm code cuality

- Traduce the current C functions (at extern.c) to nasm
  - _drw_vx_vy_nibble (opcode)
  - _get_keys (interface operation)
  - _draw_display (interface operation) 

- Implement Timers (delay and sound)

- Improve opcode switch stement to a adress table.
  (Currenty if there are 'n' opcodes in a same
  nibble, it may cost O(n) to find the corresponding
  function for that opcode. Thats because the current 'switch'
  statement is more like a if-else statement).
